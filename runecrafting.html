                    <p class="pathway-tree-text"> When this rune is resolved, summon a Rune Golem. The Rune Golem
                        enqueues the cycle resolving this rune. When the Rune Golem resolves Rune of Construction, it
                        instead attacks an enemy. After its cycle ends, the Rune Golem is destroyed.</p>
                    <p class="pathway-bold">Rune of Accuracy</p>
                    <p class="pathway-tree-text"> When this rune is resolved, all existing allied Rune Golems gain +1 to
                        hit on their next attack.</p>
                    <p class="pathway-bold">Rune of Augmentation</p>
                    <p class="pathway-tree-text"> When this rune is resolved, grant all existing allied Rune Golems an
                        additional effect: When you perform a successful attack on a battling enemy, do not become
                        destroyed at the end of your cycle. Enqueue your previous cycle after your cycle ends.</p>
                    <p class="pathway-bold">Rune of Enchantment</p>
                    <p class="pathway-tree-text"> When this rune is resolved, your next successful attack deals bonus
                        PMD equal to the number of runes that have been resolved this combat.</p>

                    <p class="pathway-tree-text"> When this rune is resolved, immediately resolve the next rune in the
                        cycle. This rune has no effect if it is the last rune in a cycle.</p>
                    <p class="pathway-bold">Rune of Duplication</p>
                    <p class="pathway-tree-text"> When this rune is enqueued, destroy this rune. Replace it with the
                        next rune in the cycle. This rune has no effect if it is the last rune in a cycle.</p>
                    <p class="pathway-bold">Rune of Recycling</p>
                    <p class="pathway-tree-text"> When this rune is resolved, enqueue your current cycle into a
                        simultaneous sub-cycle. If the sub-cycle contains Rune of Cycling, replace it with Rune of
                        Acceleration.</p>
                    <p class="pathway-bold">Rune of Extension</p>
                    <p class="pathway-tree-text"> When this rune is enqueued, add two rune slots to the end of the
                        cycle. When this rune resolves, transform it into a Rune of Acceleration.</p>

                    <p class="pathway-tree-text"> When this rune is resolved, the nearest battling enemy takes 1D4 PMD.
                        This damage repeats for each time Rune of Harm has resolved this combat.</p>
                    <p class="pathway-bold">Rune of Protection</p>
                    <p class="pathway-tree-text"> When this rune is resolved, until the end of your turn, gain Temporary
                        HP equal to 5x your INT.</p>
                    <p class="pathway-bold">Rune of Reflection</p>
                    <p class="pathway-tree-text"> When this rune is resolved, gain the following effect until the start
                        of your next turn: As a reaction, when an enemy creature targets you with an ability or attack,
                        you can force them to make an INT saving throw against you. Upon failing this throw, negate that
                        ability or attack. Any effects/damage that would be inflicted upon you by their action is
                        instead inflicted onto them. This rune can only be enqueued in the final rune slot of a cycle,
                        and if Rune of Acceleration would resolve this rune, it instead has no effect.</p>
                    <p class="pathway-bold">Rune of Destruction</p>
                    <p class="pathway-tree-text"> When this rune is enqueued, resolve the effect of Rune of Harm. When
                        this rune is resolved, destroy all remaining runes in the cycle. Enqueue each empty slot in the
                        cycle with Rune of Destruction.</p>

                <p class="pathway-ultimate-bold">Rune of Ascension</p>
                <p class="pathway-ultimate-text"> When this rune is resolved, if you are a Rune Golem, become
                    invulnerable to damage. Otherwise, gain the following effect: enqueuing a Main Cycle no longer has a
                    CP cost, and you may now enqueue the same rune twice in a cycle.</p>
