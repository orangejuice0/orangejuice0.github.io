                    <p class="pathway-tree-text"> At the start of your turns, once per combat, you may choose to spend
                        all of your CP. Gain 5FT movement for each CP spent this way until either the combat or
                        Rejuvenating Waltz ends. While Rejuvenating Waltz is active, you may no longer damage enemies.
                        Targeting allies with attacks heals them for half the damage the attack would deal. Rejuvenating

                        Rejuvenating Waltz ends. If multiple allies have this ability, it only activates once.</p>

                        your turn. Immediately end Rejuvenating Waltz and remove its associated effects. All battling
                        enemies lose HP equal to your bonus movement from the effects of Rejuvenating Waltz and Rising
                        Tension before it was removed. Enemies are additionally afflicted with 1 turn of Paralysis, 2
                        turns of Dazed and 3 turns of Entranced.</p>

                        HP reaches 0, the Villain becomes victorious, granting it +1 to all its rolls for the rest of
                        combat and ending all other effects of and relating to Set the Stage. If the Villain’s HP
                        reaches 0, you may designate a new Villain. There may only be one Hero and one Villain at a time
                        in each combat.</p>

                    <p class="pathway-tree-text"> Battling allies not designated as the Hero are designated as Admirers.
                        Each time an Admirer successfully attacks the Villain, apply one of the following effects to the
                        Hero in order: Heal 5 HP; Randomly increase one stat by 1 until the end of your next turn;
                        Reduce the duration of an ailment you are afflicted with by 1 turn (only applies to ailments
                        afflicted during the combat). Each Admirer may only activate one effect per round.</p>

                    <p class="pathway-tree-text"> If the Hero reduces the Villain’s HP to 0, all Admirers heal 10 HP. If
                        the combat has not ended, the Hero additionally gains advantage to all rolls until the end of
                        their next turn.</p>

                    <p class="pathway-tree-text"> If the Hero’s HP would reach 0, instead heal the Hero to their Max HP
                        and set their CP to 5. The Hero additionally gains +5 to all their rolls against the Villain. If
                        the Villain remains alive at the end of the Hero’s next turn, reduce the Hero’s HP to 0. This
                        effect can only activate once per combat.</p>
